# Brisbane day trip ideas without a car

Please research the details of these trips before you try them! I haven't only tried a few of these things with public transport! - LG

**1. See Brisbane by river.**

Get on the CityCat anywhere (e.g. UQ, Toowong, the City, South Bank) and ride it as far as it goes. The CityCat runs between North Shore/Hamilton and UQ, and stops on both sides of the river.

**2. Visit the Gold Coast**

You can get the train to Varsity Lakes and then a bus to various beaches. Search for a bus to Burleigh Heads National Park. The Burleigh area has surf beaches, Tallebudgera Creek for swimming without waves, a national park, and shops/cafes. It is less touristy/commercial than e.g. Surfers Paradise.

**3. Visit Walkabout Creek and the Ennogera Resevoir**

This is a very easy one to access. Get the 385 bus to The Gap Park n Ride (24 minutes from Roma St). From here it's a few minutes walk to the Walkabout Creek Discovery Centre. This info centre will tell you what you can do. You can do the Enoggera Reservoir Circuit and walk by the lake.

**4. Visit the Glasshouse Mountains**

There are a number of walks in the Glasshouse Mountains of varying difficulties. You can get there by taking a train to Glass House Mountains Station (the Information Centre is here) or Beerburrum Station - the train trip takes 1 hour from Brisbane City. This map shows some of the starts of the walks:

Note 1: I haven't tried this so you'll want to research and see if it's actually easy to get to the starts of the hikes. 

Note 2: Mt Tibrogargan is hard, make sure you know what you're getting into. Mt Ngungun is a walk recommended for kids but I'm not sure if it's accessible by public transport.

**5. Mt Coot-tha**

A classic. There's a bus to the Botanic Gardens, and another free shuttle bus to the top of Mt Coot-tha.

**6. Visit Ipswich**

Easily accessible by train. Queens Park sounds nice.

**7. Visit Toohey Forest**

In the middle of Brisbane, accessible by bus. Look up where the starts of the walks are and you should be able to find some buses.

**8. Climb Mt Gravatt**

In the middle of Brisbane, accessible by bus. Look up where the starts of the walks are and you should be able to find some buses.

**9. Australia Zoo**

Get a train to Beerwah Station. The zoo runs a free shuttle bus to and from the train station.

**10. Visit Karawatha forest**

Get a train to Trinder Park Station. The Information Centre is 1.5 km from here
